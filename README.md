Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of fundamental machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a practical toolkit for training and evaluating various models, designed to showcase and compare their performance on both regression and classification tasks.

Key Features
- Regression Models: Includes implementations of classic and advanced regression algorithms, such as Simple & Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
- Classification Models: Features a wide range of classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- Performance Evaluation: Each algorithm is rigorously evaluated with standard metrics (e.g., MSE, MAE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) to facilitate a clear comparison of their effectiveness and training time.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.
NumPy: For efficient numerical and array operations.
Scikit-learn: A robust library providing pre-built and optimized machine learning models.
XGBoost: For high-performance gradient boosting models.
